Implement the time separator with Timer 0, Timer 1 and Timer 2. The system should generate the time separator (half second blink) of the digital clock with multiple timers. Every timer should have dedicated indicator (say 1 LED per timer).


Output Requirement:

All three LEDs assigned to specific timer should toggle at frequency of 0.5 Hz (500 msecs) as soon as the board is powered on or reset.
There should be time synchronization between all LEDs on longer runs greater than hours (No drifts in the output should be seen).
Inputs:
-Timer0
-Timer1
-Timer2
