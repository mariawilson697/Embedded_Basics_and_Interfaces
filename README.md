# Embedded_Basics_and_Interfaces
This repository contains foundational embedded systems codes, covering peripherals, protocols, and functionalities like GPIO, PWM, UART, and I2C for 8-bit microcontrollers (e.g., PIC16F877A). Developed as part of my learning journey, I executed these codes in PICSimLab to demonstrate hands-on expertise.
